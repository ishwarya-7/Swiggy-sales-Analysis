Swiggy Sales Analysis Dashboard (Excel Project)

This project analyzes Swiggy order data using Microsoft Excel to uncover insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and food category trends. The dashboard highlights key KPIs such as Total Sales, Total Orders, Average Rating, and Average Order Value (AOV), along with monthly, daily, and regional sales trends. Interactive slicers enable filtering by month, restaurant, and category, helping identify top-performing states, popular food types, and peak ordering periods.
